### Research startups may have more luck fundraising pre-PMF, but in the end success means building something people want.

We just made the painful decision to shut down my three-year-old startup, Skyglass. 

#### What was Skyglass?

We had built a virtual production app for iPhone, powered by Unreal Engine cloud rendering. It made it easy for anyone to shoot videos in realistic virtual worlds and preview the final result in real time.

#### History

* Idea
* NAB Show
* Launch
* AI video
* Raising our first round
* Feature development 
* Ad-fueled growth
* Techstars
* AI video again
* Trying to raise our second round
* Deciding to shut down

#### Lessons Learned

* Product focus is better than research focus, but if you want to raise without metrics, research focus is better
* Know which kind of company you are and be 100% straightforward
